# Buttercup

## A Compass-Foundation starter framework

Currently built on Foundation 4.1.6 and Compass 0.12.2

#### What is this?

Buttercup is <a href="http://pendragondevelopment.com">my</a> attempt at creating a starting point for my future projects, whether it be websites built on <a href="http://statamic.com">Statamic</a> or <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>, interaction prototypes for my <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Rails</a> or <a href="http://laravel.com">Laravel</a> applications, or just something I want to throw together quickly. When I participated in the <a href="http://hackforchange.org">National Day of Civic Hacking</a>, it took me far too long to get my framework set up for a simple Jekyll blog, so I decided at this point, it's a good idea to have something ready to go.

#### Why Foundation?

Why <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com">Foundation</a> versus <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a> (which is nice) or <a href="http://cferdinandi.github.io/kraken">Kraken</a> (which is also very nice) et al.? Mainly because Foundation is built on <a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a>, which I use in all of my projects, Rails or otherwise. That's not a knock against LESS or the hard work folks have put into keeping Twitter Bootstrap updated on Sass, it's just what I work with.

#### Where to from here?

This is my boilerplate. It has all of the modules and extensions that Foundation has to offer so I can rapidly develop prototypes and websites. I'm licensing any changes I've made (which really is just this HTML document) under the <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/">WTFPL</a> - so fork it and do with it as you please.
